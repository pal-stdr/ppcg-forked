# HOW TO SYNC CHANGES IN THE GITHUB FORKED REPO WITH THE PARENT/SOURCE (e.g. `ppcg`) REPO from [`https://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git`](https://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git)

- **E.g. This [`ppcg-forked`](https://github.com/pal-stdr/ppcg-forked.git) repo is a forked copy from parent [`https://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git`](https://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git) repo. Now if some latest changes comes in the `master` branch of parent `ppcg`, then how can you keep sync of all branches of `ppcg-forked` with the `ppcg`?**

- **The same concept works, when you and your mates are working in separate branches. You can keep your branches updated with the changes your mates are doing.**


## 1. Ensure if you have the `upstream` link to the original repo

### 1.1. If you don't have the `upstream`, then you have to add it manually

[How to fork a GitLab repository to GitHub?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65025709)

- Let's check what we have as remote `alias`. 

```sh
git remote -v

# Returns (upstream doesn't exist)
origin  git://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git (fetch)
origin  git://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git (push)
```

- Looks like repo link is named as `origin`. Actually this is the `upstream` link, which is [`https://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git`](https://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git) link. So let's rename it to `upstream`

```sh
# Format
# git remote rename [old-alias] [new-alias]

git remote rename origin upstream

# Let's check
git remote -v

# Returns (upstream doesn't exist)
upstream  git://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git (fetch)
upstream  git://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git (push)
```

### 1.2. (Optional, For very first time, setting up everything from scratch) Add our own `github` forked repo link (typically `origin`)
- Now we have to add our own `github` forked repo link (typically `origin`)


```sh
# Formula - git remote add upstream <original_repository_url>
git remote add origin https://github.com/pal-stdr/ppcg-forked.git

git remote -v

# Returns
origin  https://github.com/pal-stdr/ppcg-forked.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/pal-stdr/ppcg-forked.git (push)
upstream        git://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git (fetch)
upstream        git://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git (push)
```


### 1.3. (Optional, For very first time, setting up everything from scratch) Push the `master` branch in `github`

```sh
git push origin master
```




## 2. Fetch the changes from the upstream repository

**This will only load the latest changes from original repo. But in next steps, you have to merge it.**

```sh
git fetch upstream
```


## 3. `checkout` the `master` branch to merge all the changes from `upstream`

**This is where you are actually connecting the changes from [`git://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git`](git://repo.or.cz/ppcg.git) to [`github ppcg-forked`](https://github.com/pal-stdr/ppcg-forked.git)**

- **This kind of merge works like `fast-forward` style. So you don't have a new merge commit.**
- **SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT BE CONFLICT WITH YOUR OWN CODE vs THE INCOMING CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL REPO. That time `fast-forward` merge will not work. You have to manage the merge conflict by hand.**

```sh
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master

# Returns
Updating 001cb37..655ca80
Fast-forward
 configure.ac | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```



## 4. Do the same for other local branches

```sh

# Fetch changes from the upstream (If you did it already, donot need to do it again)
git fetch upstream


# Checkout and merge for branch 'feature1'
git checkout feature1
git merge upstream/master

# Checkout and merge for branch 'feature2'
git checkout feature2
git merge upstream/master

# Checkout and merge for branch 'bugfix1'
git checkout bugfix1
git merge upstream/master
```
